for example 75 marks
const grade = studentGradeGenerator(75);
// Output: The grade is: B

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Description
This program takes the speed of a car as input. It checks if the speed is above or below the speed limit (70 km/h). If above, it calculates demerit points and checks if the license should be suspended.

Demerit Points Calculation
1 demerit point for every 5 km/h above the speed limit.
Usage
Call the function speedDetector with a number representing the speed of the car.
For example 80km/s
speedDetector(80);
// Output: Points: 2
If demerit points exceed 12, the function will print: "License suspended".

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Description
This program calculates an individualâ€™s net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It calculates gross salary, deductions (NHIF, NSSF, PAYE), and net salary using predefined rates.
I used net salary = gross salary - NHIF - NSSF - PAYE ;

Usage
Call the function netSalaryCalculator with two numbers: basic salary and benefits.

netSalaryCalculator(50000, 5000);
// Example output details the gross salary, NHIF, NSSF, PAYE, and net salary.
